Please Gif Star ?? Stars make me happy.  I'm open to design automation for other games (doesn't have to be a discord game) just let me know
# Regards to Report of Bot not Working 
I have ran several test of bot for long amounts of time and it has ran several rolls and claims without stopping if you are submitting a issue of bot not working plesae explain and show some amount of basic troubleshooting. everytime i have to launch a test of the bot staying it requires a minimum of like 8 hours just to confirm if it works as intended or not. Future issues posted without basic troubleshooting will be closed as this is getting out of hand. 

I will be add a test folder within the repo so that I can provide you guys with images that show that it is working on my end

# Regarding Issue Creation
Lately I have been getting alot of **Issues** that is not based on problems with the bot but they regard `Python Environment Errors` I.E `discum module not found`/`discum not installed properly` I have attempted to help many users that have had this problem but it is very time consuming. Python Environment issues are not a problem with the **BOT** but how one has installed python this varies from user to user.There are archived issues where a user has had a environment issue and they have resolved it you can use that as a reference.
If these resources do not help there are plenty of resources online to help you resolve your `Python Environment` Issue

+ Claims / Bot didn't claim X character - Please make sure you have checked if the `bot has not claimed already within the claim window` , or that `someone else did not already claim X character before the snipe protection has expired`

+ Maximizes rolls by tracking roll timers
+ Waifu/Husbando rolling

## How it works
All this bot needs to work is your Discord _usertoken_ and the channel IDs that you want it to post in

This is intended to be completely automated; it doesn't need to take any input other than initial settings configuration.
You'll be able to leave the window running in the background, and not need to think about it.

## Requirements

+ Python 3.7+
+ discum 1.3+

# Configuration
To configure the bot, you'll edit the variables in the **Settings_Mudae.json** file for your botting needs.

## Bot settings
All settings are set within the Settings_Mudae.json File

+ `token` - The user token for the account you want to bot on. If you need extra assistance on how to obtain it, let me know.
+ `channelids` - Which channels to **roll** and **monitor**  e.g. 807##########948
+ `slash_ids` - Which channels to **Slash roll** e.g. 807##########948 (Please Match Slash_id with slash_guild_id)
+ `slash_guild_ids` - Which Guild to **Slash roll** e.g. 807##########948 (Please Match Guild id with Slash_id)
+ `claim_delay` - _Affects servers w/o $setting instance_ Time in **seconds** to wait before attempting to Claim Characters e.g. 5
+ `kak_delay` - _Affects servers w/o $setting instance_ Time in **seconds** to wait before attempting to snipe Kakeraloot e.g. 8
+ `use_emoji` - This setting only works if you change the Mudaebot.py code by uncommenting out the line (Custom emojis only) e.g.  "<:emoji_name:795############214>"
+ `roll_this` - ($m|$ma|$mg|$w|$wg|$wa|$h|$ha|$hg) If `Rolling` is enabled it will roll this specific command e.g. '$wg'
+ `Rolling` - (True|False) **Case-sensitive**, uses `channelid`
+ `slash Rolling` - (True|False) **Case-sensitive**, uses `Slash_ids`
+ `PkmRolling` - (True|False) Pokeslot rolling enabled, uses `channelid`
+ `series_list` - **Case-sensitive** Name of series of characters you want to claim  e.g. \[ "Honkai Impact 3rd" , "Senran Kagura" \]
+ `name_list` - **Must be exact match** List of specific character names to claim  e.g. \["Raiden Mei", "gOkU" \]
+ `emoji_list` - This is the kakera that will be snipes \[ "KakeraY" , "KakeraO" \] << This example means only snipe Yellow and orange Kakera
+ `min_kak` - A minimum kakera value to snipe a claimable character _regardless of whether it's in the series/name lists_
+ `Last_True` -  (True|False) enable Last Minute Claim windows
+ `last_claim_min` - (1-180) the window the window is open for e.g. 10 means last 10 minutes
+ `min_kak_last_min` - same as min kak but only within the last minute claim window

# Optimize the snipes
Typing $settings in your server with mudae should give you the snipe and kaksnipping timers.
Using these values you usually snipes faster than a "Human" user can react 

Please when settings Delays avoid setting 0 as your delay as it might be to fast for mudae
a minimum of 1 second to let mudae register that a character was rolled as is reacted to.

# Use at your own Risk
This is a Discord **selfbot**. I am not responsible if you get banned using this program. 

# Closing Notes
I understand that this readme is not as detailed as many would like and I'm sure there are many more questions that one may have.

Currently I'm still supporting this repo so feel free to **Contact Me** if you are having any Issues (Setup , Bugs , Feature suggestions)

As for updates those will be added up until I no longer feel like this project is fun.

for Assisting with Discum it was definitely not something I'm used to.
